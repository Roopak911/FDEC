- Repeat above steps for launching other 5 instances and just replace "HOME" in the above script with "MOBILE" and "LAPTOP" for resoective instances.
- After this you would be having 6 instances launched with 2 instances hosting "HOME" site, 2 instances hosting "MOBILE" site and 2 instances hosting "LAPTOP" site.
- Also in the script you will change the echo command to "sudo echo "<h1>THIS IS MOBILE PAGE $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/mobile/index.html" for instances hosting
  "MOBILE" website and  for the instances hosting "LAPTOP" websit echo command will change as "sudo echo "<h1>THIS IS LAPTOP PAGE $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/laptop/index.html.  



#####Step2 :- Creating 3 target groups attaching 2 same hosting websites instances.

- Click "target type" as instances and 
- Insert target name in the required field and keep rest of the settings to as it is.

- Repeat above steps to create remaining 2 target groups. Provided for "MOBILE" website you will set 
  health check path to "/mobile/*" and same for "LAPTOP" you will set health check path to "/laptop/*"
- After these steps you will be having 3 target groups created and each target group will have 2 instances hosting same website.




#####Step3:- Creating an Application Load Balancer

- Click on "Load Balancer" located at the bottom left corner of the EC2 dashboard.

- Repeat above steps to create another rule for the third target group hosting "LAPTOP" website by making changes to the path value inside add condition field as "/laptop/*"
  and selecting priority to 201.
- Afetr this you will be having three rules for the elastic load balancer which will describe the path for the particular webpage i.e. "HOME", "MOBILE" and "LAPTOP".




#####Step4:- Launching the webpages

- Copy the DNS of the load balancer and paste it in the browser. You must see "THIS IS HOME PAGE (hostname of your instance)".
- In the address bar of your browser type "/mobile/" after your load balncer's DNS. You must see "THIS IS MOBILE PAGE (hostname of your instance)". 
- In the address bar of your browser type "/laptop/" after your load balncer's DNS. You must see "THIS IS LAPTOP PAGE (hostname of your instance)".
