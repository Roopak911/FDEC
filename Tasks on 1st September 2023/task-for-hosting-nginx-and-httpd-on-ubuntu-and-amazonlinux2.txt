                                      ########Task of hosting NGINX and HTTPD on same server in Ubuntu and Amazon Linux 2########
									 

########Hosting NGINX and Apache on Ubuntu :-
- You can follow following steps to host Nginx and Apache2 on same server.
1. Launch an EC2 instance with AMI Ubuntu, setting inbound rule to add ports 80 and 81 in security group and take SSH.
2. Write down following commands to install and start nginx on the server :-
  - sudo -i (for login as root user).
  - apt-get update (to update Ubuntu).
  - apt install nginx (to install nginx package)
  - service nginx start (to start nginx service)
  - service nginx enable ( to enable nginx service)
  - copy instance's public ip and paste it in the address bar of the browser and check whether server test page opens or not.
3. Nginx server has been installed and running on the instance.
4. Write down following commands to install and start Apache2 on the same server :-
  - apt install apache2 (to install apache2 package)
  - before starting and enabling apache2 service we must move the root directory of the apache2 server from "/var/www/html/index.html" to some other location like
    "/var/www/html/apache2/index.html".
  - to achieve above results we must edit the configuration file for the apache 2 server located at "/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf" using vi editor and paste the 
    path "/var/www/html/apache2/index.html".
  - now we will assign port no. 81 to the apache2
  - vim /etc/apache2/ports.conf and change "listen 80" to "listen 81".
  - service apache2 start (to start apache2 service)
  - service apache2 enable ( to enable apache2 service)
  - copy instance's public ip and paste it in the address bar of the browser and paste ":81" after that and check whether apache2 server runnig or not.
  
  
  
  
 
########Hosting Nginx and hhtpd on the Amazon Linux 2 :-
- You can follow following steps to host Nginx and Apache2 on same server.
1. Launch an EC2 instance with AMI Ubuntu, setting inbound rule to add ports 80 and 81 in security group and take SSH.
2. Write down following commands to install and start nginx on the server :-
  - sudo -i (for login as root user).
  - yum install update (to update Amazon Linux 2)
  - amazon-linux-extras install nginx1 (install nginx package)
  - systemctl start nginx (to start nginx service)
  - systemctl enable nginx (to enable nginx service)
  - copy instance's public ip and paste it in the address bar of the browser and check whether server test page opens or not
3. Nginx server has been installed and running on the instance.
4. Write down following commands to install and start httpd on the same server :-
  - yum install httpd (to install httpd package on the server)
  - vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf.
  - in the same configuration file change "listen 80" to "listen 81".
  - systemctl start httpd (to start httpd service)
  - systemctl enable httpd (to enable httpd service)
  - copy instance's public ip and paste it in the address bar of the browser and paste ":81" after that and check whether apache2 server runnig or not.
